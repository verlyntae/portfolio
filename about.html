		<h2>About Me</h2>
		  	<p>What is up?!!!! Thank you for checking out my portfolio.  I guess one of the questions floating around in your head right now is "How is this guy?" Well, if you just sit back, relax, and fasten your seat belts, you'll get all the particulars. So hang tight or loose and get ready. </p>

		<h1>Formative Years</h1>
		<p>I grew up in a slightly musical, religious household, so I'm an artist and prone to structure by nature. I say "slightly" because although we were musicians and singers, we didn't have a lot of musical training. Most of my real musical training came from listening to records, radio, and watching music videos. As a kid I remember hearing a lot of gospel music, blues, and rock n' roll, which explains a lot about my tastes and personality. As a young child, I was totally enamored with the bands and artists like The Rolling Stones, Rod Stewart, The Faces, Led Zeppelin, Bad Company, Queen, Alice Cooper, KISS, John Lee Hooker, B.B. King, Howling Wolf, Muddy Waters, Jimmy Hendrix, T-Rex, David Bowie, and/or anything that had a rockin' guitar in it. To be honest, Alice Cooper kind of scared me as a child, but his music was rockin', so I'd continue to listen and learn guitar riffs.</p>
			<br>
		<h1>Rock n' Roll Fantasy</h1>
        	<p>After school I decide to start a band with some other like-minded musicians who all had similar musical influences- rock, blues, 70's/80's punk, and reggae. We practiced till our fingers bleed, played gigs, and travelled the country in a vans. But after the record deal went south, I woke up from my musical fantasy and decide to go college.</p>
			<br>
		<h1>The Present</h1>
			<p> After surviving my rock n' roll fantasty, I found a new passion in computers, technology, and programming, which I have combined with another new found passion- graphic design. </p>
