		<h1>About Me</h1>
		  	<p>Thank you for checking out my portfolio.  I guess one of the questions floating around 	             in your head right now is "Who is this guy?" Well, if you just sit back, relax, and                  fasten your seat belts, you'll get all the particulars. So hang tight or loose and get                ready.

		<h1>Formative Years</h1>
			<p>I grew up in a slightly musical, religious household, so I'm an artist and prone to 				   structure by nature. I say "slightly" because although we were musicians and singers, 				we didn't have a lot of musical training. Most of my real musical training came from                  listening to records, radio, and watching music videos. As a kid I remember hearing a 			   lot of gospel music, blues, and rock n' roll, which explains a lot about my tastes and                personality. As a young child, I was totally enamored with the bands and artists like 				  The Rolling Stones, Rod Stewart, The Faces, Led Zeppelin, Bad Company, Queen, Alice 				   Cooper, KISS, John Lee Hooker, B.B. King, Howling Wolf, Muddy Waters, Jimmy Hendrix, 			   T-Rex, David Bowie, and/or anything that had a rockin' guitar in it. To be honest, 				   Alice Cooper kind of scared me as a child, but his music was rockin', so I'd continue 				to listen and learn guitar riffs.

		<h1>Rock n' Roll Fantasy</h1>
        	<p>After school I decided to start a band with some like-minded musicians who all had 				   similar musical influences- rock, blues, 70's/80's punk, and reggae. By this time,                    my musical taste had gotten harder and edgier, and my skills had improved             			      tremendously. The band practiced till our fingers bleed, played gigs, and travelled   	           the country in a van. But after a record deal went south, I realized that I was living  				  in a fantasy. I woke up from my musical fantasy and decided to go to college and to  	 				get a bachelor's degree.

		<h1>The Present</h1>
			<p> After surviving my rock n' roll fantasy, I found a new passion in computers,           				 technology, and programming, which I have combined with another new found passion-                   graphic design. Now, rather than invest in musical equipment, I invest in the future                 by developing skills and purchasing training, computers, and robotics equipment.
